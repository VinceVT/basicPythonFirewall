Created a Firewall protocol in python that accepts direction, protocol, port and IP address.

I tested the code through the main method with manual inputs. I tried to make the code accept
a broad amount of inputs. If I had more time with the code I would've liked to add more exception
handling and had it be able to check for more errors. I would have also liked to restructure the code
in a more organized structure

Out of the three teams, the team that interest me most is the data team. I feel as though data manipulation
and data flow is a core component of the company. Because I want to contribute back to society as an engineer,
I believe that being able to work with data will give me a stronger outlook on things I should focus on for
upcoming projects if I am able to work within the company. My second choice team is the platform team
as it seems to be focused more on infratstructure and devops with the policy team following slightly behind.
